<h1>About Me</h1>



<p>Hello everyone, my name is Zane’ Kruger. I am 22 years old and based in South Africa. I decided to enroll in this full stack web development course as both a personal challenge and a source of motivation to transition into a completely new career path—one I had no prior background in. This journey has been both exciting and rewarding, and I am eager to complete the course and begin a career that is both fulfilling and growth-oriented.
After completing my matric, I pursued a nail technician course while I took time to better understand my long-term career goals. Over the following two years, I worked within the beauty industry, allowing me to save money and further educate myself through additional training. During this time, I completed a microneedling course and successfully built a loyal client base, achieving strong results and professional credibility at a young age.
While I am grateful for the experience and discipline the beauty industry provided, I have always aspired to work in a professional corporate environment. Although I will not be entering the legal field, I am excited about developing the skills and knowledge necessary to build a successful career in tech and to represent myself confidently and professionally when working with clients.</p>
I look forward to completing this course and, one day, reflecting on this journey with pride—grateful that I persevered and committed to building a future aligned with my ambitions.
